Ionic Framework

- Bootstraping of app is easy, ready to go sample apps - Blank, Tabs, Sidemenu
- gitignore file in place with sample app
- cli commands for page creation, provider creation to maintain hierarchy and nomenclature
- shared providers/services to be used across multiple modules

- caching of service calls
- provides support for progressive web apps

Cons- 

- lacking strong forum on components of ionic2 : loadingController
